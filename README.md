# CT COVID-19 Dashboard

While there's tons of data out there and amazing GIS dashboards there's nothing,
that I can find, that provides the basic data in a more stripped down and easy
to read format. This data is being sourced from the daily reports published [on
CT's Coronavirus portal](https://portal.ct.gov/Coronavirus).

## Other Good Resources

- [Johns Hopkins GIS Dashboard](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html)
- [Johns Hopkins Data](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)
- [WeatherUnderground's Map](https://www.wunderground.com/wundermap?covid=1&lat=41.225&lon=-73.008&cm_ven=covid-map)

## TODO

- [x] Basic graphs
- [x] Actual layout
  - [ ] Less awful css
- [ ] More Stats
  - [ ] Rates of hospilitization/death
  - [ ] Age group statistics
  - [ ] Town Statistics
- [ ] Dropdown Selects for adding/removing data from graphs


While there's a lot of really good data dashboards out there I couldn't find one that focused on Connecticut and that just displayed graphs so I built one. I'm updating it daily when the new numbers go out on ct.gov. I plan to add more specific information, such as age groups, town, and rate information, but still trying to figure out how to lay it out such that it doesn't get overwhelming. Hopefully this is helpful to someone. Open to suggestions. Let me know if there's ways you think this could be better.
