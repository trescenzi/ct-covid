# CT COVID-19 Dashboard

While there's tons of data out there and amazing GIS dashboards there's nothing,
that I can find, that provides the basic data in a more stripped down and easy
to read format. This data is being sourced from the daily reports published [on
CT's Coronavirus portal](https://portal.ct.gov/Coronavirus).

## Other Good Resources

## TODO
